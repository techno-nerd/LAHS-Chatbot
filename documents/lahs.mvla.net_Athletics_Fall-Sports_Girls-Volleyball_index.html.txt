Coach Peter Kim
Coach Peter Kim
Coach Kim, has been coaching at Los Altos since 2011. In his words his views about coaching. "As coaches gain experience, however, that pursuit of winning is not as intense. He believes our work becomes more about coaching: the journey of each unique team and seeing individual players develop. You begin to enjoy all of those things a lot more and they become more important than winning. Winning is still important, of course, but you stop making yourself miserable over it. I enjoy coaching more now than ever before and I am able to learn so much more about myself and my role as a coach because I am not so worried about proving myself every day." He loves teaching and building a program that is positive. CCS Honor Coach 2022
