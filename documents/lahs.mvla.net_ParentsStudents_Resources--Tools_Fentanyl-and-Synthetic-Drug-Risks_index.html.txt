Fentanyl and Synthetic Drug Risks
Fentanyl and Synthetic Drug Risks
The opioid crisis, particularly involving fentanyl, is a growing concern nationwide and in Santa Clara County. At Los Altos High School, the health and safety of our students are our top priority. We are committed to keeping families informed, recognizing the warning signs, and working together to protect our students from the dangers of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.
Why Awareness Matters
According to the CDC, overdose deaths among teenagers linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl have tripled in the past two years. Alarmingly, 73% of teens are unaware that fake prescription pills can contain fentanyl.
Fentanyl, an opioid pain reliever 50 times stronger than heroin, is often mixed into illegal drugs or pressed into counterfeit pills resembling prescription medications like Percocet, Xanax, or Adderall. These counterfeit pills, often sold online or via social media, can be deadly.
Adding to the risk, xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer, is increasingly being combined with illicit fentanyl. Together, these substances significantly increase the likelihood of overdose and death.
Our Response and Preparedness
In response to this crisis, Los Altos High School has taken the following steps:
- Staff Training: Administrators and staff have been trained to recognize the signs of an opioid overdose and respond using naloxone (NARCAN®), an emergency medication that can reverse opioid effects and restore breathing when administered promptly.
- Naloxone Availability: Naloxone is kept in the health office (located in the student services building), in the library, in the student union, as well as with all the Automated External Defibrillators (AED) located on campus.
Recognizing an Opioid Overdose
If you observe the following signs, call 911 immediately:
• Unresponsiveness or inability to wake
• Slow or stopped breathing
• Gurgling, choking, or snoring sounds
Together, we can combat the dangers of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs by staying informed and proactive. Let’s partner to protect the health and well-being of our students and community.
