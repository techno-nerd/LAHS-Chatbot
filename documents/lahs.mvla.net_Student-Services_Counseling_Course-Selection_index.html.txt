FOOTHILL MIDDLE COLLEGE
An innovative, diverse, and flexible educational pathway
Do you ever feel like the standard high school isn't for you? Are you searching for a different academic or social experience? Then you are in the right place.
Middle College
is for intellectually-curious students who are looking for a different high school experience.  Community is central to our program's philosophy which is why so many of our students share that they finally feel a sense of belonging in Middle College. Joining this caring, safe and supportive community of students and teachers  has helped our students thrive emotionally, socially and academically.
Middle College bridges the gap between high school and college. Students take both high school and college classes on campus at Foothill College. They join a cohort of high school students who take classes together daily, and receive individualized counseling from their Middle College teachers to meet their graduation requirements.
What the Program Offers
Join a small, safe and supportive community of staff and students
Take both high school and college classes at Foothill College campus, earn up to 60 transferable college credits for free
Get individualized counseling from our Middle College staff
Explore your academic interests & direct your own education

FOOTHILL COLLEGE NOW!
Academic Opportunity for Self-Motivated Learners: College Now!
The Mountain View Los Altos High School District and Foothill College have collaborated on a program -
College Now!
- so that qualifying juniors and seniors can start college early and graduate from high school with a year or more of transferable college credit.
College Now! is ideal for students who are highly self-motivated, mature, independent, responsible, and hardworking.  These students may have 'outgrown' high school and are seeking a stimulating educational environment that is different from their home high school.
College Now! participants can experience education in a challenging and inspiring environment that engages students in college-level work while technically still in high school.  They can save thousands of dollars in tuition and fees by earning college credits at the same time they are finishing their high school graduation requirements.
Join us at one of the upcoming events to learn more about the program:
