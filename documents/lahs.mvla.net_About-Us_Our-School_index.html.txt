Los Altos High School Overview
Los Altos High School Overview
Los Altos High School is a comprehensive public school serving approximately 2230 students situated in the heart of Silicon Valley. Our attendance boundaries include residential, light industry, high technology and retail districts of the cities of Mountain View, Los Altos and Los Altos Hills. Our students are socioeconomically, ethnically, linguistically and culturally diverse.
Los Altos High School provides rigorous academics through an excellent college preparatory program for the large majority of our students, a wide range of honors and AP courses taken by over a third of our students, and a strong set of support classes and programs for students who are not meeting proficiency standards.
Students take a broad range of courses in the visual and performing arts and participate in award-winning programs throughout the arts curriculum. We offer career and technical courses in health science careers, computers, auto mechanics, and culinary arts.
Our athletics program serves more than half of the student body and has been highly successful in League and Section Competition. Numerous student clubs, an active Associated Student Body (ASB), and an award-winning student newspaper provide students many pathways to personal growth and enjoyment outside the classroom.
We participate in the Google Apps for Education and Google Classroom programs, and all students have access to digital Cloud Learning resources via personal or school-provided laptops.
Virtually all of our students graduate, with 95% enrolling in post-secondary programs.
We completed a major renovation and set of new buildings in 2002 and in the summer of 2013 we completed constructing twelve new classrooms and began renovating older classrooms.
