Press release for event here
sumbul ali-karamali
sumbul ali-karamali
Sumbul Ali-Karamali is a corporate lawyer, award-winning author, and popular speaker whose books, articles, blogs, and speaking events are her way of promoting intercultural understanding in the world. Sumbul grew up in Southern California, answering questions about Islam and Muslims. With her degree in English (from Stanford University), her law degree (from the University of California at Davis), and her additional law degree in Islamic law (from SOAS at the University of London), she started writing books to answer the very questions she’d been asked her whole life, in a way that was engaging and personal and (she hopes) fun to read. When not writing, Sumbul has been a fiction and nonfiction judge for writing competitions, a board member of nonprofits dedicated to intercultural understanding, and a member of both the steering committee of Women in Islamic Spirituality and Equality (WISE) and the Muslim Women’s Global Shura Council, both of which aim to promote women’s rights and human rights from an Islamic perspective. When she’s not doing any of that, she practices law, listens to opera, never leaves home without a book, and watches Star Trek with her family.

KEN PONTAC
KEN PONTAC
Ken Pontac
has been an animation pro for over fifty years (how the hell did THAT happen?). His early work includes the stop-motion series Gumby, as well as the various iterations of the classic video game Clayfighter and ten years of writing for the Sonic the Hedgehog games. Pontac wrote and story-edited multiple episodes of the notorious Happy Tree Friends (a show so violent that it's banned in Russia but has still enjoyed over a billion hits worldwide).  Most famous meme? Wrote the Icelandic ear-worm You Are A Pirate.
Give it a listen
; it’ll lay eggs in your brain, and the eggs will hatch, and all the earworms will dance in your brain.
His cult classic stop-motion series Bump in the Night is available in a compilation produced by Mill Creek Entertainment. PontacÊ¼s work on the delightfully pro-social animated series Arthur may offset some of the karmic debt incurred by his other literary efforts but will probably only bump him up from tapeworm to tree-frog on the reincarnation cycle.
Pontac recently completed a documentary,
Out From The Ashes
, about his (SPOILER ALERT) successful efforts to extricate a Ukrainian family from a Russian filtration camp.
Pontac lives in Sausalito with a beautiful redheaded nurse, a tranquil Xoloitzcuintli named Chalupa, and a not-so-tranquil Xoloitzcuintli named Ziggy Stardust.
