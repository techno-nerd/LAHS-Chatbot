About the
TEDx Program
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

Shakti Ann Kanyal
Shakti Ann Kanyal is a sophomore at Los Altos High School. She has been a victim of bullying for almost all her life. This has taught her the people you surround yourself with and the amount of time you spend on social media determine your confidence. At school, she is a two-sport Varsity athlete and an officer of many clubs including a Spirit Club, Hispanic Appreciation Club, and a Tennis Club that helps teach tennis to kids with disabilities. In her free time, she runs Tiktok page @Shaktianntalks where she shares her viewpoints on many topics like bullying, grades, change, and most importantly confidence. Her goal is to teach her audience how to have a logical mindset that questions the criticism and comparison one might have in order for them to be happy and confident rather than letting others' words tear them down.
