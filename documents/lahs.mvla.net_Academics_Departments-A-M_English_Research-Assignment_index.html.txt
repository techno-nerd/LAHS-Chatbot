Research Assignment
We expect students to complete a variety of assignments that require them to learn about the world beyond the classroom. Our research assignments ask students to learn about their families, their cultural background, their community, American literature and culture, and in the Senior Project, virtually any topic they desire. In all cases, we ask students to conduct their research using both primary and secondary source materials. Students present the results of their research in a variety of formats, from the traditional research paper, to a video documentary, to an audio-visual presentation in front of an audience of their peers.
