Writer's Week
Celebrating 40 Years of Storytelling
Writer's Week
From March 4-7, Los Altos High School (LAHS) is holding the 40th annual
Writers Week event, which brings a diverse and inspiring lineup of writers, poets and journalists
to all English classrooms.
Each Writers Week features a special evening event open to the entire community. This year’s
celebration will feature acclaimed author and humanitarian, Dave Eggers, in conversation with
LAHS students. To celebrate our 40th anniversary, we are hosting a party starting at 6:30 PM on
Thursday, March 6. Join us for food, literary trivia, book giveaways, and signings with our guest
author! At 7:00 PM, the audience will head to the theater for a conversation with Dave Eggers.
The students will interview Mr. Eggers about his writing, sharing insights from a workshop they
participated in, where they crafted pieces about the unexpected good that can emerge from
difficult experiences.
The Tracey Cullinan memorial fund helped establish Writers Week in 1985. The LAHS PTSA
now funds Writers Week, believing that learning is reinforced, enhanced and inspired by visiting
writers. Past visiting authors have included Jose Antonio Vargas (Dear America), Andy Weir
(The Martian), Andrew Sean Greer (Less), Mary Roach (Packing for Mars), Gail Tsukiyama (The
Street of a Thousand Blossoms), Daniel Handler (Adverbs), Khaled Hosseini (The Kite Runner),
John Houston (Continental Drift), Daniel Alarcon (Lost City Radio), Wallace Stegner, and Amy
Tan.
