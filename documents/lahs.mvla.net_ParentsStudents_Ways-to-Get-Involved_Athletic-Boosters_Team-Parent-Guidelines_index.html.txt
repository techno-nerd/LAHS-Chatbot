Team Parent Guidelines
Thank you for volunteering to be a Team Parent!
The Team Parent responsibilities outlined below are to act as a GUIDE - each team has a different set of demands, so modify as needed for the team to function effectively.
Contact the coach early in the season to arrange a mandatory meeting for all parents of the team members. Feel free to assign/delegate responsibilities to other parents to share the workload.
Work with the COACH to set up if necessary:
Practice and game schedule
Team roster with parent names, cell phone numbers, email addresses (and athletes’ jersey or cap numbers if available)
Refreshment/drink schedule
Uniform distribution AND COLLECTION.
Arrange a team potluck dinner early in the season
Assist the coach in organizing any mid-season team parties and the end of the season celebration.
Recruit parent volunteers for the four main Athletic Boosters fundraisers.
View Details
Team Pictures are arranged by the Athletic Director. The coach will distribute order forms.
Each team honors the graduating seniors at the end of the season (usually the last home game). Check with the coach near the beginning of the season to determine their preferred approach.
Athletic Boosters meetings are held once a month and team parents are encouraged to attend.
