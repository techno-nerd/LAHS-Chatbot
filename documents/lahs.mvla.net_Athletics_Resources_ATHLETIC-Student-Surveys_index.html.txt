ATHLETES: Please complete the appropriate survey. The input you give us will improve our athletic programs and assist us in the evaluation of the athletic coaches. The information is confidential and will be shared with the Athletic Director and Administrators. A summary of your responses will be shared with each coach at the end of the season in their evaluation meeting.
