Information Resources for Parents
Here are the most commonly used resources for parents to stay up to date with school events and deadlines.
Aeries (SIS)
- Aeries is the primary system used by the district for student grades, attendance, and demographic information. Accounts are automatically created for parents when their student is registered using the email address on file with the school.
ParentSquare
- ParentSquare is the main communication tool being used by the district for sending district and school-based information to families, incl. Principal Message called Eagle Community News. Please join ParentSquare groups such as the PTSA or Athletic Boosters to make sure you are receiving their information. You can choose to receive information by email, text, or app notifications as well as choosing to receive individual updates or a daily digest of messages.
Daily Announcements

LAHS Parents Forum (Google Group)
- This email list is an informal parent-to-parent resource if you have questions about LAHS.
To join, please indicate your CHILD'S NAME and GRADE for verification purposes and YOUR NAME.
Information Resources for Students
Students need to check multiple websites to stay on top of classwork, homework assignments, and grades. Here are the primary sites to track.
Aeries (SIS)
- Aeries provides grade information for each class a student is taking, including grades for each entered assignment. Students use their MVLA email address (automatically created by the school) to log in.
Google Classroom / Canvas
- teachers may use either system for their classroom websites. These sites may include slides from each class session, homework assignments, and other information needed for the class. The teachers will communicate this information to students at the beginning of the semester.
TeachMore
- TeachMore is an app for students to schedule where they will be for ACT on Wednesdays and Fridays.
Classlink - ???
Student Clubs
