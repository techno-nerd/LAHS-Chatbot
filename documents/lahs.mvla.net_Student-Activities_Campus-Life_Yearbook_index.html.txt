Senior Portraits
The senior portrait yearbook deadline is Dec. 11, 2024!
Now is the time to schedule senior portraits. Book your free yearbook session at the Now and Forever Studio in Los Gatos by calling the studio: at 408-354-8660 and asking for the free yearbook session with no option to order the photos. Or book
online
if you’d like a full portrait session and plan to order photos. Seniors have the option of choosing a drape, tux, or black graduation gown provided by the studio for the yearbook portrait.
The last day to take a senior portrait is Dec. 11, 2024, which is also the on-campus portrait day. More details on the on-campus portrait day will be provided in early December.
Senior recognition ads are always a big hit!
Every year seniors race to the end of their yearbooks to see if their friends and family have purchased a senior tribute ad for them. It’s
a truly special way to honor your student’s achievement
. 2025 will be an even more important year to make this accomplishment feel special! Senior Ads are purchased and designed through the Varsity Yearbook site directly. Do not pay for a yearbook on this site, only purchase your senior ad.
All senior ads are due by December 11.
Early bird pricing for ads through the month of October. Order directly on the
Varsity Yearbook website
.

1. Go to

3. Click on senior ads (note: book sales are through our
school webstore

4. Select ad size and follow the directions to upload photos, add text, and then pay for your final dedication.
