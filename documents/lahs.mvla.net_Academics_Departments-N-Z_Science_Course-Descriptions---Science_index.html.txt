Environmental Science AP is designed to be the equivalent of an introductory college course in environmental science The goal of the Environmental Science AP course is to provide students with scientific principles, concepts and methodologies required to understand the interrelationships of the natural world, to identify and analyze environmental problems both natural and human-made, to evaluate the relative risks associated with these problems, and to examine alternative solutions for resolving or preventing them. The Environmental Science AP course is an excellent option for any interested student who has completed two years of laboratory science in Biology and Chemistry.
The course includes laboratory and field investigations. The goal of this component is to complement the classroom portion of the course by allowing students to learn about the environment through firsthand observation. Experiences both in the laboratory and in the field provide students with important opportunities to test concepts and principles that are introduced in the classroom, explore specific problems with a depth not easily achieved otherwise and gain an awareness of the importance confounding variables that exist in the “real world”.

Recommendations: Biology A or Bio Honors B or better; Chemistry A or Chem Honors B or better. Either completion or concurrent enrollment in Physics. If interested in Biology project it is highly recommended to have or be enrolled in Biotech and/or AP Biology.
This course is being designed as a capstone course for our science department. Students taking this course are some of our best students who have completed a number of AP/Honors courses in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.
Students enrolled in this class will develop scientific questions that they are interested in. They will then learn how to research this question by accessing primary research sources and ultimately develop a research plan. It is expected that students will then independently do the research during class and ultimately report their findings at the end of the year via a formal presentation. Along the way they will learn how to conduct a literature review, how to develop a research proposal, how to execute their research plan, and ultimately present their research findings to their peers and teachers.
