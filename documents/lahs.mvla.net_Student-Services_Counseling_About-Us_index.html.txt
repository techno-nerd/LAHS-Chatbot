About Us
About Us
We are passionate about helping our students succeed! Each LAHS student is partnered with a school counselor who helps support them throughout all four years of high school. In collaboration with our College and Career Center and other school resources, the LAHS school counseling curriculum supports students in the following three areas:
Academic Advisement
College & Career Planning
Social & Emotional Wellbeing
Our school counseling model ensures that LAHS school counselors make connections with our students through planned individual appointments, small group workshops, and schoolwide presentations and events throughout the school year.
LAHS school counselors also help students connect with the other excellent support resources on campus to make the most of their four years at LAHS. Our College and Career Center (supported by the
MVLA Foundation)
is an integral part of our team and we work in tandem to help our students plan for and achieve their post-secondary goals.
We also maintain close partnerships with our families. LAHS parents have the opportunity to attend some of their students' individual counseling appointments and are invited to multiple parent informational workshops throughout the school year. Our L.U.C.H.A. parent education program offers workshops to our Spanish- speaking families throughout the school year.
Our counselors are also engaged members of our school communities.
Several of our counselors serve as advisors to to student clubs and faculty organizations. Our school counselors also serve on our school leadership teams, wellness committees, and school climate advocacy and activisim groups.
Our Vision & Mission
The Los Altos High School Counseling Department is committed to promoting the LAHS vision of a healthy, equitable learning environment in which students and staff support one another, as well as its mission to provide the best educational experience possible for our students.
