WASC Accreditation
WASC Accreditation
Los Altos High School is currently engaged in the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) re-accreditation process. This process provides an opportunity for us to reflect on our programs, student outcomes, and overall operations to ensure we are delivering a high-quality educational experience for all students.
In November 2024, the WASC visiting committee was on campus to observe classes and meet with parents, students, teachers, and other staff members as part of the re-accreditation process.
Below, you will find resources related to our accreditation, including key documents that highlight our self-reflection, goals, and the findings of the visiting committee. Additional documents will be posted here as they become available, providing ongoing updates on our progress.
