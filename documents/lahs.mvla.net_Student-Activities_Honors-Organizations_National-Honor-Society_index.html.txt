National Honor Society
The National Honor Society (NHS) and National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) are the nation's premier organizations established to recognize outstanding high school and middle level students. More than just an honor roll, NHS and NJHS serve to honor those students who have demonstrated excellence in the areas of Scholarship, Leadership, Service, and Character (and Citizenship for NJHS). These characteristics have been associated with membership in the organization since their beginnings in 1921 and 1929.
Today, it is estimated that more than one million students participate in activities of the NHS and NJHS. NHS and NJHS chapters are found in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, many U.S. Territories, and Canada. Chapter membership not only recognizes students for their accomplishments, but challenges them to develop further through active involvement in school activities and community service.
Sophomores and Juniors,
if you are passionate about service, leadership, and character and have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher, consider submitting an application for membership in LAHS's chapter of the National Honor Society.
Applications
are generally made available at the beginning of 2nd semester. Student should check the daily announcements for information about when the application is available.
Student, keep in mind that the
NHS application
takes more time to complete than the CSF application and also requires students to submit letters of recommendation. Plan accordingly.
