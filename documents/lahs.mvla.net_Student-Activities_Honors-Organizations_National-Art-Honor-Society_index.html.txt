National Art Honor Society
The National Art Honor Society (NAHS) was established in 1978 by the National Art Education Association for high school students grades 9-12. Its purpose is to assist student members to attain their highest potential in all forms of art, and to raise awareness of art education throughout the school and community. The National Art Honor Society provides national recognition and opportunities for students who exhibit outstanding scholarship in the visual arts. Participation in the NAHS also provides peer recognition, leadership growth opportunities, college and career preparation, and community service volunteer work opportunities.
