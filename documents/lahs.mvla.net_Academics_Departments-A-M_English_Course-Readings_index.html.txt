LOS ALTOS HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
MAJOR WORKS ASSIGNED IN COLLEGE PREPARATORY
AND HONORS ENGLISH CLASSES
Listed below are the major texts assigned and films shown in English classes at Los Altos High School.  You will probably recognize some of the titles from your own reading and viewing while others may be new to you.
The literary works we have selected deal with a range of human experience, insight and values. In making literary selections, we consider the difficulty of a text or film in terms of its vocabulary, sentence/cinematic structure and style, its thematic connection to the lives of students at Los Altos, and its place in literary and cinematic history.  We ask ourselves: Will this book or film challenge the strongest readers/viewers yet be accessible to the weaker readers/viewers?  Does this book or film model the kind of writing we would like students to emulate? Are there experiences and themes in this book or film which students can see in their own lives or in the world around them? Will this work broaden the students' cultural, intellectual and psychological horizons?
Considerable educational research has shown that extensive reading is the single most important factor in determining a student's long-term educational success. A direct correlation exists for almost every student: Extensive reading leads to educational success, while limited reading leads to educational difficulty.  In addition, good readers write better, have better vocabularies and are typically more knowledgeable in subjects beyond English.
You and your student should know that English teachers will expect 80-100 pages of reading each week, typically 20 pages each school night. Honors and A.P. classes typically require 120-200 pages of reading each week.
We encourage you to read the texts and view the films listed.  Doing so sends an important message to our students about the importance of reading and the class work we do. We hope that you will enjoy revisiting works that you read as a high school student and that you will find some unfamiliar gems in the newer fiction.
Contact your student's English teacher to confirm which of these texts he or she will be assigning and which films will be shown over the course of this year.
If you feel that a text or film is inappropriate for your son or daughter you may request an alternate assignment. As noted, some films may have an "R" rating. Contact your son’s or daughter’s English teacher, in writing or via email, if you would like an alternative assignment for a specific text or for any or all “R” rated films.
