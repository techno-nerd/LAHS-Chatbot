WELCOME TO THE LOS ALTOS HIGH SCHOOL PTSA!
WELCOME TO THE LOS ALTOS HIGH SCHOOL PTSA!
Our PTSA is dedicated to the health, well-being, and educational success of the students attending Los Altos High School.
The PTSA brings together Parents, Teachers, and Students to support programs that enhance the educational experience for each LAHS student.  In addition to monetary support, there are many PTSA volunteer opportunities to get involved in on campus. PTSA meetings are a great way to stay informed; Principal Tracey Runeare and Superintendent Nellie Meyer give reports and take questions.
The PTSA strives to provide support to the school community. We invite you to become members and participate in Los Altos High School’s PTSA.
We look forward to a successful school year together.
