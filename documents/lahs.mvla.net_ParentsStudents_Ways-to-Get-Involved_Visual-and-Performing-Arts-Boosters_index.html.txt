All parents of instrumental students are Performing Arts Booster members! It's a great way to meet other parents and be involved in your student's high school life.
Attend Booster Meetings.
Share your ideas, hear the Music & Choral Directors' updates, and learn what our current activities and needs are. Meetings are generally held the first Monday of the month at 7:00 PM. Our meetings are virtual for the convenience of parents to join.
Donate generously to the Performing Arts Boosters.
Performing Arts Boosters is the sole parent and community source of funding for the performing arts department. We do not hold major fundraising events, but rely primarily on our Direct Appeal Campaign for donations from the parents and community. Donations can be made through the “Parent Membership and Donation Form” that will come in the school-wide mailing from LAHS OR directly paid to the Music Boosters. To pay directly, please make check payable to: "LAHS Performing Arts Boosters" (Memo: “Direct Appeal 2024-25”) and mail to: LAHS Performing Arts Boosters c/o Treasurer, 201 Almond Avenue, Los Altos, CA 94022.

with any questions, or to donate via square.
The LAHS Performing Arts Boosters is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, EIN #77-0525170. Your contribution is tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. For federal income tax purposes, you can deduct the contribution amount less the fair-market value of any gift you may have received.
Volunteer, it's fun.
We would love to have you volunteer to help at events, rehearsals and competitions as well as behind the scenes! It is a great way to connect with other music families. You can
email Chris
for volunteer opportunities.
Encourage your students to join one of the choruses, ensembles, Marching Band or Color Guard.
Please check the Instrumental Music Department website. Everyone is welcome. No music, marching or dance experience is required for MBCG! Auditions may be required for other ensembles.
Each season of Marching Band and Color Guard qualifies for one semester PE exemption during the 10th through 12th grade years.
Contact Us.
Finally, the Music Boosters has an extensive Board made of parents representing each music ensemble. If you feel like joining us in any of the roles, please reach out to us! We are committed to making this year both successful and enjoyable for all. :)
Questions, suggestions? Feel free to email us.
