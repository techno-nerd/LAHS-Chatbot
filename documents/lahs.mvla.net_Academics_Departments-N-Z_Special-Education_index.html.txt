Special Education
The Special Education Department provides services to students with learning and other disabilities. Program offerings are determined by student need. Eligibility for Special Education is based on a thorough assessment consisting of both academic and psychological testing.
Students may be referred for an assessment for Special Education.  Within 15 days of a referral for assessment, the student's parent/guardian will receive (a) a notice outlining parental rights and (b) a proposed assessment plan explaining the types of assessments to be conducted and which states that no individualized education program will result from the assessment without parental consent.
If a parent or guardian has a reason to believe that their student requires special education services, they should contact the student’s counselor. Parent(s)/guardian(s) may also contact the LAHS Special Education Program Specialist,
