Head Coach- Christina Sabin- christina.sabin@mvla.net
Head Coach: Christina Sabin
Christina began her lacrosse career close to ten years ago in Granite Bay, California. Although she admits to having a challenging first year, she managed to stick with the sport and made her team at Granite Bay High School the following year, where she ended up lettering all four years and became SVLC Champions in 2014. Christina also received an SVLC All-Conference Honorable Mention (2014), an SVLC Academic All-American (2014), and a USL Academic All-American (2013). After graduating from Granite Bay High School, she went on to play Division III lacrosse at Occidental College where she was a key defender and received a SCIAC All-American Sportsmanship Award in 2017. She coaches because she thoroughly enjoys being an advocate for young women in sports. She has also found that there is great value in coaching a sport that is team-centric, focuses on hard work, and values perseverance. Her goal as a coach is to help young players expand their skills and increase their communication on the field so that they can be their best selves off the field.
