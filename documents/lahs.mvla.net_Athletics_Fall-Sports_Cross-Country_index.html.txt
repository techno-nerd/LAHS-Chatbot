Head Coach: Stephanie MacKenzie
Coach MacKenzie has been Coaching at Los Altos High School since 2016. She has been Coaching for 5 years. She has been running competitively for over 30 years. She loves exploring new trails and running to the top of a mountain to see the view. Her favorite place to run with the team is at Westwind Barn & Hidden Villa. She loves coaching cross country because we have a huge team with athletes of all levels. Everyone can set their own personal goals and they all celebrate when someone runs a personal record or completes their longest run ever. “I hope to encourage all our athletes to become lifelong runners because it will improve their health and well-being.”
