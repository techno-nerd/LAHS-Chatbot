Welcome to the LAHS Associated Student Body (ASB)
Welcome to the LAHS Associated Student Body (ASB)
The Associated Student Body (ASB) is committed to cultivating a positive, inclusive school culture where every student’s voice is valued. By organizing events and supporting the many student clubs that form each year, ASB plays a vital role in creating a vibrant school environment where all students feel connected and supported. These activities offer students opportunities to express themselves, take on leadership roles, and create lasting memories with their peers. ASB fosters a strong sense of community while encouraging student engagement in every aspect of school life.
What We Do:
Student Leadership
: ASB is made up of student leaders who represent the student body, work closely with administration, and help make important decisions that impact the school community.
Event Planning
: From pep rallies and dances to community service events and fundraisers, ASB organizes a variety of activities that bring students together and build school spirit.
Advocacy & Representation
: ASB serves as a platform for students to voice their opinions and ideas, ensuring that student concerns are addressed and that all students have opportunities to get involved.
Student-Run Clubs
: ASB oversees and supports the formation and operation of student-run clubs, helping students charter new organizations that align with their interests and passions. Whether it’s academic, cultural, artistic, or service-oriented, clubs provide students with a platform to explore their interests, develop leadership skills, and connect with like-minded peers.
How to Get Involved:
Join ASB
: Students interested in leadership roles, event planning, or student advocacy are encouraged to apply to be a part of the ASB team. Information about how to join is released in the spring semester.
Attend ASB-Sponsored Events
