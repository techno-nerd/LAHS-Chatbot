includes information about where and when clubs meet. Students need only show up to a club meeting in order to get invovled. There is no need to apply in order to join a club or make an appointment to attend a meeting.
ASB organizes a 2-day-long club fair at the start of the year. That's an excellent opportunity for students to learn about most of the available student organizations.
