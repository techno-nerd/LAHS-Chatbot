Find the Right Course for You: Compare and Decide
Find the Right Course for You: Compare and Decide
At Los Altos High School, we aim to empower students to make informed decisions about their education. Selecting the right courses is a key step in creating a schedule that aligns with your academic goals, personal interests, and other commitments. Thoughtful course planning helps ensure that you can achieve a healthy balance and set yourself up for success.
To support you in this process, we’ve provided one-page information sheets for each department. These resources outline the differences between courses, helping you understand your options so you can choose the classes that best fit your needs and aspirations.
We also encourage you to consult with your counselor if you have questions or would like advice. Counselors are here to guide you in considering how different courses align with your goals and overall schedule.
